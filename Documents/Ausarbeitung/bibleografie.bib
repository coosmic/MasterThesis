    abstract = "{Developing automated methods to efficiently process large volumes of point cloud data remains a challenge for three-dimensional (3D) plant phenotyping applications. Here, we describe the development of machine learning methods to tackle three primary challenges in plant phenotyping: lamina/stem classification, lamina counting, and stem skeletonization. For classification, we assessed and validated the accuracy of our methods on a dataset of 54 3D shoot architectures, representing multiple growth conditions and developmental time points for two Solanaceous species, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv 75 m82D) and Nicotiana benthamiana. Using deep learning, we classified lamina versus stems with 97.8\\% accuracy. Critically, we also demonstrated the robustness of our method to growth conditions and species that have not been trained on, which is important in practical applications but is often untested. For lamina counting, we developed an enhanced region-growing algorithm to reduce oversegmentation; this method achieved 86.6\\% accuracy, outperforming prior methods developed for this problem. Finally, for stem skeletonization, we developed an enhanced tip detection technique, which ran an order of magnitude faster and generated more precise skeleton architectures than prior methods. Overall, our improvements enable higher throughput and accurate extraction of phenotypic properties from 3D point cloud data.}",

ABSTRACT = {Generating 3D point clouds from a single image has attracted full attention from researchers in the field of multimedia, remote sensing and computer vision. With the recent proliferation of deep learning, various deep models have been proposed for the 3D point cloud generation. However, they require objects to be captured with absolutely clean backgrounds and fixed viewpoints, which highly limits their application in the real environment. To guide 3D point cloud generation, we propose a novel network, RealPoint3D, to integrate prior 3D shape knowledge into the network. Taking additional 3D information, RealPoint3D can handle 3D object generation from a single real image captured from any viewpoint and complex background. Specifically, provided a query image, we retrieve the nearest shape model from a pre-prepared 3D model database. Then, the image, together with the retrieved shape model, is fed into RealPoint3D to generate a fine-grained 3D point cloud. We evaluated the proposed RealPoint3D on the ShapeNet dataset and ObjectNet3D dataset for the 3D point cloud generation. Experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance. Furthermore, our proposed framework works well for real images in complex backgrounds (the image has the remaining objects in addition to the reconstructed object, and the reconstructed object may be occluded or truncated) with various viewing angles.},

	abstract = {3D point clouds are widely used in numerous research and applications, such as autonomous driving, industrial robots, and augmented reality, to represent the spatial structure of objects. The 3D point cloud registration aims to transform the source point cloud into the same coordinate system with the template point cloud, which is of great significance for the 3D reconstruction of the real world objects. ICP [1] is one of the most classic point cloud registration algorithms but it still has problems with efficiency and initialization. With the help of deep learning, PointNetLK [7] becomes a state-of-the-art point cloud registration method. Although PointNetLK is efficient and robust to some extent, it is not able to register point clouds with different scales. In this paper, we propose ScaleLK, an approach for registration of point clouds with different scales using deep learning methods. We have trained a feature extractor which supports scale feature and used this feature for registration of point clouds with different scales. We describe the architecture and compare its performance with other methods.}
